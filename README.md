### Game Rules

In a game room of 7 players, 6 people are presented the same word whereas the remaining person (the spy) gets a different one but is related to it. The game consists of several rounds. In each round, every player is given 30 seconds to describe their words in one sentence without mentioning the word directly. At the end of each round, after everyone has put down their descriptions, all people vote for the person who is suspected of being a spy. The person who got the most votes will be kicked out of the game (but can choose to remain in the room to watch the rest of the game). If the spy is voted out, then the game is over and the rest of the players win; if the spy is not voted out and there are 4 or more players left, then the game continues to the next round. If there are only 3 players left in the round, including the spy, then the game is over and the spy wins.
